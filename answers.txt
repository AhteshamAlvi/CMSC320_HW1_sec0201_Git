Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: [Because it's a useful tool for organizing and working on code in a team setting.

them from being lost as files on your computer.]

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: [Data science can be applied to almost any field that exists. All fields have some

is true about everything from construction to machine learning. There is no field that can 
avoid it when put to scale.]
