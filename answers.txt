Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: [Because it's a useful tool for organizing and working on code in a team setting.
It is also a useful storage tool in keeping secure storage of all coding projects to prevent
them from being lost as files on your computer.]

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: [Data science can be applied to almost any field that exists. All fields have some
need for manipulating, storing, and referencing data at some scale in their operation. This
is true about everything from construction to machine learning. There is no field that can 
avoid it when put to scale.]

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: [Merging combines branches by creating a new merge commit, preserving the full 
branching history. Rebasing rewrites commits to sit on top of another branch, producing 
a clean history but altering past commits.]

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: [I'm looking forward to working on some projects that I happen to be doing this 
semester. This data science class should help me in my work.]
